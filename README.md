### Gameplay

The game combines the familiar tile-merging puzzle with a simple combat system.

* **Core Mechanics**: Use the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) to move tiles on the 4x4 grid. When two tiles of the same number merge, they combine into a new tile with a value equal to their sum.
  
### Features

* **Offline**: The entire game is contained within a single HTML file, allowing you to play it offline without any internet connection.
* **Pure Web Technologies**: The project is built using only HTML and vanilla JavaScript, making it an excellent example for web development beginners.
* **Undo Function**: You can undo your last move, which is a helpful feature for strategizing.

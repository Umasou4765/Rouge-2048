### Rogue-2048

This is a roguelike twist on the classic 2048 puzzle game.

**The Goal:**
Combine numbered tiles to reach the highest possible score.

**How to Play:**
Use your arrow keys (or swipe on a touchscreen) to move all the tiles on the board. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value.

**The Twist: Roguelike Events**
Every time you merge tiles to create a new tile that is a multiple of 8 (e.g., 8, 16, 32, etc.), a special "event" is triggered. You'll be given three random choices:
- A **good** event that helps you.
- A **bad** event that creates a new challenge.
- A **chaotic** event with an unpredictable outcome.

Choose wisely! These events will change your strategy and make every game unique.

**Features:**
- Classic 2048 gameplay with a roguelike element.
- Random events to keep the game fresh and challenging.
- Simple, clean, and responsive design.
